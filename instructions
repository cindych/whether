Instructions for local build:

1. Download the client and server folders.
2. Enter each folder and run npm install to install all dependencies.
3. Start the server from within the server folder (run npm start), then start the client from the client folder (also run npm start).
4. Once started, the app can be accessed by going to localhost:3000. Backend calls may be made at localhost:8080.
