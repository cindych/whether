# CIS 4500 Final Project : whether ☁️🎵

A web app that generates a custom Spotify playlist based on the weather for some location. By default, a user
would probably input their own, but the application will allow inputting different areas as
well. The user may also adjust for other factors such as the date and overall playlist features
like liveness, danceability, and tempo of the songs.
